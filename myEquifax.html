          >is a platform that delivers free access to credit score twice a year
          and 6 credit reports a year. It allows customers to upsell to Core
          Credit which means a free monthly subscription for credit score and
          credit report. And from there, customers can upgrade to paid products
          such as Equifax Credit Monitor and Equifax Complete just launched this
          summer.

          After the first releases of the GCS design system, the team in the US
          asked me to collaborate more directly with the product team. From that
          point, I’d be accountable for:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The design system maintenance and progress.</li>
          <li>
            New design work for myEquifax Premium product and to translate US
            design to the Canada and Australia context.
          </li>
          <li>
            Review and guide design decisions from third-party vendors to comply
            with best practices and the design system.
          </li>

        <h2>Signin page</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="cell large-8">
        <p class="">
          Although I wasn’t not in charge of the signing funnel I reviewed
          analytics data and I found we had almost 35% of signing fails. There
          was no initiative to attack this problem so I started to work on how
          to improve the signing experience and to reduce the failings using
          quick research methods and evaluating possible solutions that would
          demand low effort and big impact.
        </p>
        <p>
          I mapped the whole flow, from setting the password to the first
          signing. The application has some demanding rules for password
          creation due to security concerns that are out of my reach so I needed
          to work inside this frame. My first assumption was that it is too
          difficult to remember this kind of password due to these requirements.
          But what was the difference with another kind of password that users
          will remember effectively?
        </p>
        <p>
          MyEquifax was being used in the US and I was far away here in Dublin,
          but the experience would be pretty similar, which I’d found out later.
          Using a mock, I set a short scenario where a user would need to create
          the account, following the user and password requirements and then
          trying to login manually for the first time. I discovered that most of
          the time they were failing at the creation of the password and then at
          the login, they were using special characters not allowed in the
          password ruleset.
        </p>
        <p>
          So I prototype a password reveal component that we tested and help
          users to have lees errors, I tested icon vs text variations. I don’t
          have access for A/B testing which would have been my choice to go. But
          after building and launching the best tested version we reduce the
          signing errors from 36% to 10% which means we reduce call center cost
          by about $xxxx. Happy story at the end.
