        <h3>GCS Design System</h3>
        <p>
          At the end of 2018, Equifax launched myEquifax.com, a Credit score and
          Report solution in the US which was built and delivered by the GCS dev
          teams in Dublin. This first release had only a few features available
          to consumers for free, but there were already big plans for incoming
          paid product launches.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Problem:</strong> <br />
          myEquifax US, would be replicated in other domains like the UK, Canada
          and Australia. This pushed the Dublin team to escalate its technical
          implementation and design language to set the collaboration between
          20+ teams in 5 countries.

      <div class="cell large-8">
        <p>
          I partnered with front end engineers and the UI architect at the
          beginning to build and expose our components library; designing
          examples, writing documentation and use cases in a Confluence page.
        </p>
        <p>
          I defined all the minor elements (design tokens) of the system and
          connected all the components and patterns to this set of tokens
          (colour, typography, spacing, etc.). Then we worked extracting all the
          styling files from myEquifax-US to build an external theme that could
          be reusable. These set of libraries components, design-tokens,
          documentation and examples, and the UI theme were the first step of a
          basic system that today lives as part of a global platform. This
          global platform and the Design System would be used by 20+ teams in 6
          countries to create myEquifax Canada and UK.

        <p class="">
          I managed to become the gatekeeper of the visual elements of the DS,
          helping to set a process where creators/collaborators and consumers of
          the system could design and define components, patterns and a
          catalogue of custom icons, all exposed in the showcase that I helped
          to design and build.

        <p>
          The GCS Design system is today the official system to develop
          consumer-facing products having continuous improvements based on a
          backlog of loop feedback of other product teams.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nowadays the GCS Design System is supporting applications with xxx
          million users monthly and it’s an internal reference of design,
          content and code standards, it helps onboarding new members in GCS,
          and sets a communication bridge with third-party vendors. It delivers
          consistency and development speed to the teams and projects in the UK
          and Canada, besides the US.

          My initial research and
          <a href="https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/interface-inventory/"
            >interface inventory</a
          >
          raised several consistency issues such as many shades of blue, and
          several colour contrast violations. We had different borders,
          backgrounds and link styles; similarly, we did not have a consistent
          typographic scale nor a systemic way to set margins and paddings among
          other issues. Based on all that and our architecture I decided to
          document those design decisions in a separate group called Design
          Tokens. The plan was to scale our system to support different
          development platforms and to align design using the same logic.

          Design tokens are an agnostic approach to organise the essential
          elements of a system, it allows you to abstract and control the
          information that will provide basic consistency. To implement our
          Design tokens strategy I create and rewrite some of the code removing
          pieces from the original project. I took the same approach in our
          Sketch library.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          “Design Tokens are a methodology. IMHO, saying “design tokens are just
          variables” is like saying “responsive design is just media queries”.
          It’s a technology-agnostic architecture and process for scaling design
          across multiple platforms and devices, including native, and more.”

          Our design tokens catalogue included all the minimal pieces such as
          colours, typography, spacing, shadows, borders and backgrounds, then,
          I tight the components property to this set of design tokens. For
          colour tokens, I designed a shade scale for each of our primary,
          secondary and tertiary colours. This way, we were able to organise and
          reduce the number of different colours available to be used.

          I’ve been removing all the unused variables in our code base and then
          tied them up to our new tokens making all the components dependent on
          a few sets of SASS variables. Since we are not a full team dedicated
          this is an ongoing task. It provided us with the option to use tools
          like Theo or StyleDictionary to scale our rules to other development
          platforms. As every platform has its own rules, design tokens help us
          overcome those pain points to deliver consistency. Independently of
          the technology used. But that’s a different story, check my article
          related to design tokens.

      <div class="cell large-8">
        <p class="">
          I design and help to build a quick showcase of the visual elements of
          the system, a classic Design System website where we added all the
          documentation needed to understand the guidelines and to use it to
          build better applications, more accessible and at speed. We use our
          own theme to build the showcase, exposing the design tokens, the
          angular components with working code documentation, accessibility and
          design guidelines, examples for grid and layouts, responsiveness, and
          templates pages in code and Sketch to speed up the process. I also
          linked the Sketch library repo and added a getting started guide for
          developers and designers.

          The showcase allowed us to put the system in public though our first
          release (internally) and start collecting feedback to improve it. We
          feed the system with what our (internal) consumers are demanding, like
          the need of an icons catalogue and SVG guidelines for new icons, or
          add general to specific accessibility feature, especially for
          entry-level developers. This way, we started to make work sessions
          with dev teams to understand their use of the system and what problems
          we were solving in between, and ultimately understand what the system
          could do for them. We followed a similar process with PMs and
          different business units that could benefit from the use and rely on
          the GCS Design System. Like when we started to discover the
          inconsistency in our writing and language.

      <div class="cell large-8">
        <p class="">
          After some releases, we got to a point where we had a solid structure,
          guidelines, a set of tested accessible angular components, with
          extensive documentation for implementation and use, a set of sketch
          libraries for any designer who needs to start working in new mockups.
          Nowadays we do weekly upgrades and releases following a 2 sprint
          cadence paired with dev teams here in Dublin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently we have a different goal in mind which is dissemination,
          adoption, and a way to collect constant feedback from our internal and
          external users. This is an ongoing effort with constant iterations.

          valuable to not only our colleagues but also third parties. This would
          mean that we would have to make training and work sessions to
          disseminate the system, weekly meetings where we’ll invite people of
          different roles to gather their doubts and requirements that we could
          take as Jira tickets and add to our Design System infinite backlog.

          This project was born from no requirements, rather by an undercover
          need that my manager and I saw. It helped me to build my position as a
          designer where I set practices and processes so the system could feed
          the products, and products could feed the system.

        <p>
          A design system is never done, there are always fixes, bugs and
          improvements to make, such as experiment with react components,
          building a templates library in Sketch or planning to add
          microinteractions. I have continued maintaining and co-leading the
          system, designing new components and solutions that help to develop
          better products for myEquifax.
