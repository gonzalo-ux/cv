        <p>
          In 2020 my partner and I started to work with the Universidad de
          Santiago, Chile to improve their webpage for the
          <a href="http://www.mef.usach.cl/index.php/es/" target="_blank"
            >M.S. in Finances and Economics </a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Problem:</strong> <br />
          The website looked old and with outdated information which confuses
          applicants to the master redirecting all the queries to emails and
          calls. <br />
          “Master in Economy” search term showed the website number 15 in the
          second page.

        <p>
          This project was made 100% online. <br />
          I lead the product design work and front-end implementation, my
          partner Eliette H. carried the content design work, we divided
          research tasks. I set a Google Analytics account for the website, and
          I installed a script to track metrics in Hotjar. I designed the visual
          elements of the website and had to implement styles and pages working
          with Joomla to build the pages and manage the content. I also worked
          setting interviews and tests with participants online back in Chile.

        <h2>Research</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="cell large-8">
        <p>
          We started by auditing the content from our audience in order to
          define a common language.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using Google Trends we searched, compared and registered the most used
          terms from our audience. We built the first Glossary terms that added
          to interviews helped us to define Voice + Tone, labeling strategy for
          micro-copy and design short and meaningful headings to navigate the
          content. This set of elements was documented in a Content
          guidelines(Spanish), made by Eliette Hermosilla, to be used in the
          future by the Master’s office.

          Google analytics and Hotjar allowed us to map our first data about
          user navigation and behaviour in the website. These help us to
          concentrate the efforts prioritizing the pages with heavy navigation
          and the key elements that would allow someone to send an application.
          The number of applications would be our main business goal to track
          during the project.
        </p>
        <p>
          On another hand, we did a full review of queries to the support email
          of the Master, which gave us a sense of the problems that users might
          face when using the current website and which was the information that
          was missing or confusing them to achieve their applications. It also
          helped us to contrast with the list of terms that we had form Google
          trend searches, we ended up changin many terms based on what we found
          in the emails.
        </p>
        <p>
          After reviewing, organizing and filtering almost 300 queries in a
          spreadsheet we ended up building three profiles:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Undergraduates of the same University</li>
          <li>Undergraduate of a different University</li>
          <li>Undergraduate from a different country in South America</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We combined this with analytics of users flows to focus the energy to
          make clear that information related to Courses details of the Master,
          entry requirements and application process.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of our findings was that users were always looking for key pieces
          of information to decide to apply to the Master such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Important dates such as application timeframe and the start of
            classes
          </li>
          <li>Cost of the Master and scholarships</li>
          <li>Schedules</li>
          <li>What to do in case of doubts</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          We had a short time frame, so I moved quickly to design and validate
          with figma prototypes as we interviewed former and current students
          from the M.S. and also gathered feedback from engineers that were
          looking for similar M.S. We assembled these users in groups and we
          tested our assumptions with some of them representing different flows
          and states.
        </p>
        <p>Based on our research we find that a user could be:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>In an early stage looking for a Master</li>
          <li>
            With an inclination for this kind of Master, but unsure about which
            program to apply to
          </li>
          <li>
            Already decided for this program, but uncertain about how to apply
            and what are the requirements.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          For these three scenarios, It was necessary to structure the
          information and content, grouping chunks of information with enough
          value to understand the process and links to navigate to a specific
          section. This helped to reduce the confusion and guide the applicants
          for the right path.
        </p>
        <p>
          We setted a permanent aside section with all the information that was
          most requested along with a CTA to start the application and contact
          information with the Master offices.

          The current page was running in a Joomla CMS which was far from my
          knowledge. But I got to manage and did the css and html work. The main
          issue was to install joomla and used to build locally but it never
          worked. Instead I used local overrides with Google chrome so I could
          push directly to the browser with my local set of Sass and CSS files.

          The Master duplicated the amount of new students even with the COVID
          pandemic in between, thanks to the website improvements and a small
          email marketing campaign. The website went up to the 5fth place in
          Google searches and increased significantly the pages visited and the
          amount of time of users. We reduced the emails and calls with queries
          regarding to basic information of the Master.
