        <p>
          In 2020 my partner and I started to work with the Universidad de
          Santiago, Chile to improve their webpage for the
          <a href="http://www.mef.usach.cl/index.php/es/" target="_blank"
            >M.S. in Finances and Economics </a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Problem:</strong> <br />
          The website looked old and with outdated information which confuses
          applicants to the master redirecting all the queries to emails and
          calls. <br />
          “Master in Economy” search term showed the website number 15 in the
          second page.

        <p>
          I lead the product design work and front-end implementation, my
          partner carried the content design work, we divided research tasks. I
          set a Google Analytics account for the website, and I installed a
          script to track metrics in Hotjar. I designed the visual elements of
          the website and had to implement styles and pages working with Joomla
          to build the pages and manage the content. I also worked setting
          interviews and tests with participants online back in Chile.

        <h2>Research</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="cell large-8">
        <p>
          We started by auditing the content from our audience in order to
          define a common language.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using Google Trends, G analytics and Hotjar we were able to map our
          first personas, we had their navigation flow and behaviour in the main
          pages. These help us to concentrate the efforts prioritizing the pages
          with heavy navigation and the key elements that would allow someone to
          send an application. The number of applications would be our main
          business goal to track during the project.
        </p>
        <p>
          On another hand, we did a full review of queries to the support email
          of the Master, which gave us a sense of the problems that users might
          face when using the current website and which was the information that
          was missing or confusing them to achieve their applications.
        </p>
        <p>With ended up building three profiles:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Undergraduates of the same University</li>
          <li>Undergraduate of a different University</li>
          <li>Undergraduate from a different country in South America</li>

        <p>
          We had a short time frame, so I moved quickly to design and validate
          with figma prototypes as we interviewed former and current students
          from the M.S. and also gathered feedback from engineers that were
          looking for similar M.S. We assembled these users in groups and we
          tested our assumptions with some of them representing different flows
          and states.
        </p>
        <p>Based on our research we find that a user could be:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>In an early stage looking for a Master</li>
          <li>
            With an inclination for this kind of Master, but unsure about which
            program to apply to
          </li>
          <li>
            Already decided for this program, but uncertain about how to apply
            and what are the requirements.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          This was necessary to structure the information and content, with
          chunks of information with enough value to understand the process and
          links to navigate to a specific section.
        </p>
        <p>
          I defined a new color scheme based on an approved and used brochure
          document from the M.S and we build design elements for social
          networks.
        </p>
        <p>
          The current page was running in a Joomla CMS which was far from my
          knowledge. But I got to manage and did the css and html work. The main
          issue was to install joomla and used to build locally but it never
          worked. Instead I used local overrides with Google chrome so I could
          push directly to the browser with my local set of Sass and CSS files.

          The Master duplicated the amount of new students even with the COVID
          pandemic in between. The website went up to the 5fth place in Google
          and increased significantly the pages visited and the amount of time
          of users.
