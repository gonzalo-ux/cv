          is a platform that delivers free access to credit score twice a year
          and 6 credit reports a year. It allows customers to upsell to Core
          Credit which means a free monthly subscription for credit score and
          credit report. And from there, customers can upgrade to paid products
          such as Equifax Credit Monitor and Equifax Complete just launched this
          summer.

          After the first releases of the GCS design system, the team in the US
          asked me to collaborate more directly with the product team. From that
          point, I’d be accountable for:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The design system maintenance and progress.</li>
          <li>
            New design work for myEquifax Premium product and to translate US
            design to the Canada and Australia context.
          </li>
          <li>
            Review and guide design decisions from third-party vendors to comply
            with best practices and the design system.

        <p class="">
          Although I wasn’t not in charge of the signing funnel I reviewed
          analytics data and I found
          <strong>we had almost 35% of signing fails</strong>. There was no
          initiative to attack this problem so I started to work on how to
          improve the signing experience and to reduce the failings using quick
          research methods and evaluating possible solutions that would demand
          low effort and big impact.
        </p>
        <p>
          I mapped the whole flow, from setting the password to the first
          signing. The application has some demanding rules for password
          creation due to security concerns that are out of my reach so I needed
          to work inside this frame.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong
            >My first assumption was that it is too difficult to remember this
            kind of password due to these requirements. But what was the
            difference with another kind of password that users will remember
            effectively?</strong

          MyEquifax was being used in the US and I was far away here in Dublin,
          but the experience would be pretty similar, which I’d found out later.
          Using a mock, I set a short scenario where a user would need to create
          the account, following the user and password requirements and then
          trying to signin manually for the first time. I discovered that most
          of the time they were failing at the creation of the password and then
          at the login, they were using special characters not allowed in the
          password ruleset.
        </p>
        <p>
          I worked with different alternatives and finally I prototyped a
          password reveal component that might help users to have lees errors
          and this way improve the success signing. I tested icon and text
          buttons and checkboxes and switches to activate the show/hide event. I
          considered translation to different languages that could impact the
          length of the text button. I don’t have access for A/B testing which
          would have been my choice to go. But after testing with random users
          we landed on the simplest and more direct idea.

          After launching we gather more feedback from users that help us to
          quickly fix bugs especially after observing users navigation the
          signing with Screen Readers which led us to improve tab index
          navigation and how the message shall be read out when using assistive
          technology.

        <p>
          If I had access to A/B testing we would have been able to experiment
          with other alternatives and maybe decrease the signing failures even
          more.

          Through my work in the
          <a href="work-design-system.html">Design System for GCS</a> I helped
          to improve accessibility aspects especially colour contrast issues. I
          provided a set of guides and tokens so developers and designers could
          build with clear colour contrast in sync, especially in case of errors
          and or important information.

          I designed and implemented a consistent focus treatment for all our UI

          that navigate using exclusively the keyboard.
